                    <p class="bio-blurb">Hello and welcome! I am Angie, originally I am from Florida and recently moved
                        here to New Jersey. I can be a quiet and timid person most of the time.
                        However, once I get comfortable I can be the most hilarious person there is. Below, I included a
                        few things about me that I would like to share.</p>

                    <p class="bio-title">Shows I am currently enjoying: </p>
                    <p class="bio-blurb">
                        Who doesn't like a to sit down and relax to a good show.
                        I love my comedies so I have to add two that really do make
                        me laugh out loud. Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Abbott Elementary
                        are definitly big recommendations from me. On a more serious
                        note, while I'm not the biggest comic book fan, I do find myself
                        enjoying both Lucifer and Moon Knight. I didn't even know Lucifer
                        was a comic book until someone showed me. Finally, it's Yes to the Dress!
                        With my wedding coming up I've been binging this and still can't get
                        enough.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bio-title">What I am looking forward to this summer:</p>

                        <li>Trying at least two new activities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bio-title">Pets I had growing up:</p>
                    <p class="bio-blurb">Growing up, my parents loved to care for animals, this is something they
                        instilled in my siblings and me.
                        Apart from dogs, we had several kinds of birds, bunnies, chickens, turkeys, iguanas, bearded
                        dragons, and a variety of different fish.
                        Out of all the animals, my favorite was a particular fish, the Oscar, they are very observant of
                        their environment and love to interact with you.</p>
                    <p class="bio-title">My goal for my education:</p>
                    <p class="bio-blurb">This year I set a goal to go back to school, which I am proud to say that I
                        did! Ultimately, I want to graduate with my degree in Web Development.
                        I want not only just learn the materials, but I would also like to really understand what I am
                        learning.</p>
                    <p class="bio-title">Where do I see myself in my career?</p>
                    <p class="bio-blurb">This is a subject that I struggle with myself. My hopes are that I can find a
                        company that I can resonate with the work or service that they provide.
                        A company that not only cares about its employees but offers an environment where you can grow
                        and move up. </p>

            <h2>CSS ANIMATION</h2>
            <div>
                <p>CSS Animation
                    CSS animation is a tool that allows us to manipulate HTML elements. This could be text, images, you
                    name it. You can almost think of this as PowerPoint animations. Transform, hide/show, change the
                    opacity, really anything you can do with CSS you can transition your element from one way to
                    another. Animations can be subtle or in your face but it always has the same intention for the user.
                    Keep the user and engaged focused! Static sites are a thing of the past. Whether you realize it or
                    not, sites you visit every day provide an enjoyable experience with the help of animations.
                </p>
                <p>There are two basic building blocks when it comes to animation:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        You have KEYFRAMES which are used to define each and every time an action should be applied to
                        the element being animated. An animation can have multiple stages allowing for a seamless
                        transition from start to finish.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        and ANIMATION PROPERTIES which is what is actually happening during these keyframes. Again,
                        these can range from a wide array of CSS rules allowing you to create whatever you can image;
                        with a little work that is.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <div>
                    <p><b>Keyframes:</b></p>
                    <p>As discussed, their role is to define each and every step and style for your animations. There
                        are a few elements a keyframe is made up of.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The name or identifier for the element you are applying these animations to. Generally, you
                            want to be straightforward with what the animation is doing so naming the element and
                            animation appropriately is a must. You wouldn't want to be fooled by a fade animation that's
                            actually bouncing some text into view.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next you have how long the duration of the animation is. Your animation can be as long or as
                            short as you want it to be, so we can think of the start of the animation as 0% and the end
                            as 100% of signaling. This is an important rule, as within those boundaries you can perform
                            the necessary animation effects or transitions you desire. Timing can be an effective tool.
                            Providing an animation too short can make the viewer wonder if it's finished, while keeping
                            the animation going longer than necessary can make the animation seem out of place or
                            something the user rather skip through.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>Animation Properties:</p>
                    <p>As stated above animation properties can provide a lot of functionality, here is a view:</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>animation name - The name of the animation, remember be straightforward</li>
                        <li>animation-duration - How long you intend the animation to run</li>
                        <li>animation timing function - This allows you to specify how fast or slow you want the
                            animation to go. However, you don't need just one speed. Using this you can change the speed
                            at different intervals creating a curve.</li>
                        <li>animation-delay - This can be used to specify a delay before the animation will start</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These are just to name a few!</p>
                </div>

                <p>Now, let's take a look at the following example. This is an interactive animation:</p>

                <p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="GdWQeV"
                    data-user="zschaffter"
                    style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
                    <span>
                        See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/zschaffter/pen/GdWQeV">CSS Fan</a> by Zack Schaffter

                </p>
                <p>When scrolling through the styling CSS and coding, you will be to glance into its keyframes. As
                    depicted in the picture below:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="keyframe example">
