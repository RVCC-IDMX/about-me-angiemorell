                    <p class="bio-title">Who Am I?</p>
                    <p class="bio-blurb">Hello and welcome! I am Angie, originally I am from Florida and recently moved
                        here to New Jersey. I can be a quiet and timid person most of the time.
                        However, once I get comfortable I can be the most hilarious person there is. Below, I included a
                        few things about me that I would like to share.</p>

                    <p class="bio-title">Shows I am currently enjoying: </p>
                    <p class="bio-blurb">
                        Who doesn't like a to sit down and relax to a good show.
                        I love my comedies so I have to add two that really do make
                        me laugh out loud. Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Abbott Elementary
                        are definitly big recommendations from me. On a more serious
                        note, while I'm not the biggest comic book fan, I do find myself
                        enjoying both Lucifer and Moon Knight. I didn't even know Lucifer
                        was a comic book until someone showed me. Finally, it's Yes to the Dress!
                        With my wedding coming up I've been binging this and still can't get
                        enough.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bio-title">What I am looking forward to this summer:</p>
                    <ul class="bio-blurb">
                        <li>Getting married in August!</li>
                        <li>Taking my dog on the trails and to the dog park</li>
                        <li>Reconnecting with my family</li>
                        <li>Getting to enjoy the potlucks</li>
                        <li>Trying at least two new activities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bio-title">Pets I had growing up:</p>
                    <p class="bio-blurb">Growing up, my parents loved to care for animals, this is something they
                        instilled in my siblings and me.
                        Apart from dogs, we had several kinds of birds, bunnies, chickens, turkeys, iguanas, bearded
                        dragons, and a variety of different fish.
                        Out of all the animals, my favorite was a particular fish, the Oscar, they are very observant of
                        their environment and love to interact with you.</p>
                    <p class="bio-title">My goal for my education:</p>
                    <p class="bio-blurb">This year I set a goal to go back to school, which I am proud to say that I
                        did! Ultimately, I want to graduate with my degree in Web Development.
                        I want not only just learn the materials, but I would also like to really understand what I am
                        learning.</p>
                    <p class="bio-title">Where do I see myself in my career?</p>
                    <p class="bio-blurb">This is a subject that I struggle with myself. My hopes are that I can find a
                        company that I can resonate with the work or service that they provide.
                        A company that not only cares about its employees but offers an environment where you can grow
                        and move up. </p>
                    <p class="bio-title">What are some of my hobbies?</p>
                    <ul class="bio-blurb">

            <h2>Pride and Predjudice</h2>
            <div>
                <p>During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it
                    time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected
                    him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de
                    Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr.
                    Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated
                    him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that “he
                    had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and
                    condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
                    approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She
                    had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make
                    up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew,
                    but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to
                    any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
                    neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.
                    She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with
                    discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved
                    all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself--some
                    shelves in the closet up stairs.”</p>

                <p>"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I dare say she is a very
                    agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near
                    you, sir?”</p>

                <p>"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her
                    ladyship’s residence.”</p>

                <p>"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”</p>

                <p>"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.”</p>

                <p>"Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of
                    young lady is she? Is she handsome?”</p>

                <p>"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty,
                    Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features
                    which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution,
                    which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have
                    otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
                    resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode
                    in her little phaeton and ponies.”</p>

                <p>"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.”</p>
