# Description
The purpose of this project 

**Top Navbar:**
The top navbar was a tough challenege, however, I was able to learn how to create a responsive navbar that changes not only visually but funcnaitlity wise when
different screens are in play. This allowed me to use different css properties and media queries.

**Gallery:**
While working on the gallery I learned how to utilize images inside of html. Not only that, I learned how to use css to create a hover effect
that changed the opacity of  the image over time. I also incorporated flex boxes which allowed me to create a grid like system that wraps as the screen
gets smaller.

**Blog Post:**
While originally the `#lit` section, I learned some of my first psuedo CSS functions. The main one used here was `:first-letter` but this allowed
me to explore into other areas within the project. I also utilized codepen in this section which allowed me to imbed an enitrely different
project directly into my own, so cool!

**Video:**
While this section was short I did learn how to use iframes within HTML.

**Contact:**
The contact form taught me how to use quite a few elements from `form`, `fieldset`, `legend`, and various input types. This also
gave me a better understand of how some sites may use the form and how they can easily impliment form validation.
